# Introduction 
The VATSSA Controller Pack is a plugin for EuroScope for use by the VATSIM Sub Saharan Africa Division (VATSSA) which combines a multitude of plugins into one, to allow for a more realistic and easier method of controlling on the VATSIM Network.
This only requires one install, as the plugin should auto update its neccesary features based off any commits to GitHub, requiring less faff amongst controllers when updating their sector files, as sector files can then be only updated for every neccesary AIRAC change, such as new procedures or waypoints.
